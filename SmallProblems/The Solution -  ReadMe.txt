All the exercises 1-4 have the unit tests in the tests folders.

1. A method that determines whether a number is a 2-power

   The solution is based on the binary representational of the number. Is fast also for large numbers.


2. A method that reverses a string (e.g. "Hello" gives "olleH").
 
  The solution works well also with the unusual characters form the Supplementary Pane of Unicode.
   It works well also with a Combining charter sequence from Unicode and with a CR-LF sequence.


3. One method that replicates a string a given number of times (e.g. ("Hi", 3) gives "HiHiHi")


4. One method that prints the odd numbers between 0 and 100.
