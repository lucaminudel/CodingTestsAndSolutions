# C# Samples


# Other languages samples
Here follow  simpler and smaller code samples in languages other than C#.

## JavaScript Samples
An experiment with JavaScript with some DOM programming, made it as a spike/exploration with a pragmatic approach. There are unit tests and integration tests, on the other side the MVC pattern and the Acceptance tests are not there yet.
