# C# Samples

## First test and related solutions
The goal of this test is to verify language skills in C # and SQL and understanding of Microsoft. NET Framework.
The first 4 tests  give the opportunity to show problem solving approach on small problems than looks simpler then they actually really are.
The last test give the opportunity to demonstrate experiences in design/architecture and back-end programming for real Enterprise Application.

The description of the test, a readme with comments for the solutions and the solutions code is [here] (https://github.com/lucaminudel/CodingTestsAndSolutions/tree/master/CShartDotNetTest1).

   

# Samples in other languages
Here follow simpler and smaller code samples in languages other than C#.

## JavaScript Samples
An experiment with JavaScript with some DOM programming, made it as a spike/exploration with a pragmatic approach. There are unit tests and integration tests, on the other side the MVC pattern and the Acceptance tests are not there yet.

## Ruby Samples
A simple Ruby code sample, the solution of the Greed dice game from the Ruby Koan exercises.
Here is the initial solution:

Here the solution extended to add 5 extra rules ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greed_(dice_game) ) with the goal to check how the initial design support the evolution:
